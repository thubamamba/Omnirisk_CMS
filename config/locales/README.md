# Rails Locales

Jumpstart Pro provides an English translation of the Rails application.

To internationalize your application, check out the [Rails I18n guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html)

## User Contributed Locales

Jumpstart Pro also comes with a few user-contributed locales.

> [!NOTE]
> These locales may not be up-to-date, but provide a starting place for translating the app into other locales.

To use them, copy example file in your locales directory and remove the `.example` extension:

```bash
cp config/locales/fr.yml{.example,}
```
