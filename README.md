# ðŸŽ‰ Jumpstart Pro Rails

Welcome! To get started, clone the repository and push it to a new repository.

## Requirements

You'll need the following installed to run the template successfully:

* Ruby 3.2+
* Node.js v20+
* PostgreSQL 12+
* Redis - For ActionCable support (and Sidekiq, caching, etc)
* Libvips or Imagemagick - `brew install vips imagemagick`
* [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) or Foreman - `brew install tmux overmind` or `gem install foreman` - helps run all your processes in development
* [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) for Stripe webhooks in development - `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

If you use Homebrew, dependencies are listed in `Brewfile` so you can install them using:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

Then you can start the database servers:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
brew services start redis
```

## Create Your Repository

Create a [new Git](https://github.com/new) repository for your project. Then you can clone Jumpstart Pro and push it to your new repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jumpstart-pro/jumpstart-pro-rails.git myapp
cd myapp
git remote rename origin jumpstart-pro
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-account/your-repo.git # Replace with your new Git repository url
git push -u origin main
```

## Initial Setup

First, edit `config/database.yml` and change the database credentials for your server.

Run `bin/setup` to install Ruby and JavaScript dependencies and setup your database.

```bash
bin/setup
```

## Running Jumpstart Pro Rails

To run your application, you'll use the `bin/dev` command:

```bash
bin/dev
```

This starts up Overmind (or Foreman) running the processes defined in `Procfile.dev`. We've configured this to run the Rails server, CSS bundling, and JS bundling out of the box. You can add background workers like Sidekiq, the Stripe CLI, etc to have them run at the same time.
